Javascript and JQuery Code Review

Week Two Code Review; Jan 15, 2015

Kate Hall

Description:

Vacation Suggester:
Create a webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery) where a user can go to answer a few questions about themselves and the site will return a vacation destination to them based on their answers. You should have at least 5 questions for your user and you should have at least 3 destinations that could be suggested.


This week's code review objectives:
All previous standards (last review's objectives) are in place (see below)
Site uses branching to return destination
jQuery is used to show and hide destination after questions are answered and submitted
Form gathers input from the user
Variable names are descriptive of what they represent
Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS


Technologies Used:

HTML CSS Bootstrap Basic commands (p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span)
